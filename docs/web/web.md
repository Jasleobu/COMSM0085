# Web Technologies

This part of the Software Tools will cover the basics of the technologies that currently make up the web. In brief, this includes:
* TCP/IP, HTTP, and the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model).
* Web page interactivity through JavaScript.
* Loading data dynamically from [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
* Web frameworks, and in particular [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The course is designed and delivered by Thomas Bale and [Marceli Wac](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/current-students/marceli-wac/).

## Activities

Over the 4 sessions on web technologies you will be building a simple app to display pet
information. Data about pets will initially be displayed statically (in the HTML), then
interactively with use of JavaScript reading from files, then dynamically via properly formed HTTP
requests to an external RESTful API. Extensions relate to adding additional functionality such as
updating or deleting pets.

Example source code is provided for each stage to accompany the video walkthroughs provided on
Stream. You can use this code as a basis for your work or start from scratch as you work through
each stage. Depending on your level of previous experience you may want to extend the activity in
the ways suggested.
