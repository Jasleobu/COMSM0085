# Activity 4: Web Frameworks

We are going to create the pet application from scratch using the React framework.

This activity is the most challenging as it makes use of a wider set of tooling and relies on new
concepts. You may therefore need to read around how to use React (see reading list for materials).
Based on your prior experience you may wish to use the boilerplate code provided as a start or begin
again. You will find two versions of the source file directories:
1.	[`web-softwaretools-plain`](https://github.com/marceliwac/web-softwaretools-plain/): A plain version which is similar to the extended output of Activity 3
2.	[`web-softwaretools-react`](https://github.com/marceliwac/web-softwaretools-react/): A fully re-written React version of the Pet-store application. 

**Complete these steps:**
1.	Watch the [walkthrough video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/03a16bcb-6b93-4538-9037-f17167dfd53a).
2.  At this point, you will need to install node - if you have done so already. You can access NodeJS’s
    website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3.  Download the React version of the project (_web-softwaretools-react_) or clone the
    [`web-softwaretools-react`](https://github.com/marceliwac/web-softwaretools-react/) repository from GitHub. 
4.  Navigate to the project's directory and install the dependencies of the project by running `npm
    install`. Then launch the local version of the website using `npm run start`.
5.  Explore the codebase and experiment with the website. Try adding components and routes that the
    user can navigate to, modify the styles, and expand on the application by displaying the data in
    new ways.

**Extensions (time permitting):**
1.	Using the code you’ve written in Activity 1-3; refactor into a React web application.
2.	Start by creating a boilerplate react application using the node create-react-app module.
You can access the documentation for running the command on the [module's npmjs page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).
3.  Try running your application using the `npm run start` command from your projects root
    directory. At that point, your browser should automatically launch the website (commonly hosted
    at http://localhost:3000/).
