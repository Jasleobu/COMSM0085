# Activity 2: Adding Interactivity

Adapt your web page to display the data provided in a given JSON file.

Here is the JSON file from the walkthrough video: [`activity_2_data.json`](../resources/web/activity2/activity_2_data.json).

**Complete these steps:**
1.	Watch the [walkthrough video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/d36e5e74-e8d5-4982-836d-b2a99732a9f8).
2.	Create `script.js` and link it to your HTML file using `<script>` tag.
3.	Read the data from the JSON object following the method covered in the walkthrough. The data file you have is slightly more complex than the one covered in the walkthrough, so you will need to think about how to correctly present values.
4.	Extend the website by adding a button. Write JavaScript function that will run when the button is pressed.
5.	Dynamically change the contents of the table from the JavaScript function youâ€™ve just written.

**Extensions (time permitting):**

1.	Write a 'save data' button to export the page data (pets only) as a CSV/JSON file.
2.	Make your page more visually pleasing perhaps integrating Bootstrap for styling if you haven't already.

Think about:
* What difference does it make to your site when you add JavaScript functionality?
* Does it make a difference where you include the `<script>` tags in the HTML?
* What are the main issues with the way we are importing data in the walkthrough example? How easy is it to update the data now?
