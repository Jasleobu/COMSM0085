# Activity 1: A basic web page

Build a static web page to display the data provided in the data.json file. The data can be embedded
directly into the HTML file.

**Complete these steps:**

1. Watch the [walkthrough video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/142696cd-fbae-4bc8-8c81-d8db6961a997).
2. Create the `index.html` and `style.css` files, and present the information provided in the data.json.
3. Present the information in a table, and add appropriate styles to the table.
4. Present the information clearly, and incorporate images.

**Extensions (time permitting):**

1. Add Bootstrap styling using stylesheet provided through a CDN (Content delivery network)
2. Make your page more visually pleasing.

**Think about the following questions:**

* How difficult it is to copy and paste data from the file?
* What happens if someone wants to add a pet to your site?
* How engaging is your site for users?
* If used the extension, what complexities did you face when using Bootstrap and what benefits did you get?
