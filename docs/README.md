## Unit Organisation

This unit is worth 20 credit points, which is one third of your second teaching block. Each week is
structured into two activities, each one containing around 2h of lectures that have been split into
several shorter videos where possible. (In a normal year a 10CP unit has 2 lectures/week, and we're
doing double that.) Each activity also comes with a set of exercises and a 2-hour lab.

This unit's main aim is to prepare you for the second-year unit COMS20006 Software Engineering
Project, where you work in groups to solve a real problem for a real client using software. Many of
the technologies you learn in this unit are ones that most groups will use in their 2nd year
projects. There is also material in this unit that is relevant for the 2nd year units COMS20008
Computer Systems A (concurrency) and COMS20009 Computer Systems B (operating systems, security).

_You must have a working microphone and camera for this unit, and you must turn both of them on if a
TA asks you to._ If you are unable for good reason (such as illness) to attend a lab, then you
should submit a [self certification for absence form](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/student-systems/) - use the link
_Engineering Student Forms_ on that page.
