## Unit Organisation

This unit is worth 20 credit points, which is one third of your second teaching block. 

Each week is structured into two activities, each one containing around 2h of lectures that have
been split into several shorter videos where possible. (In a normal year a 10CP unit has 2
lectures/week, and we are doing double that.) Each activity also comes with a set of exercises and a
2-hour-long lab.

This unit's main aim is to prepare you for the Software Engineering Group Project, your Individual
Project, and - ultimately - the workplace.

- _You must have a working microphone and camera for this unit, and you must turn both of them on if a
TA asks you to._ 

- If you are unable for good reason (such as illness) to attend a lab, then you should submit a
  [self-certification for absence
  form](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/current-students/student-systems/) - use the link
  _Engineering Student Forms_ on that page.
