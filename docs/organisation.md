# Unit Organisation

We will hold workshops on Fridays, 10am-1pm.

This unit will run in a **hybrid form**. This means that you can attend either in-person, or online---or both!

That is to say, for each workshop:
* You may come in and work on lab computers; we will be in the [Merchant Venturers Building](https://goo.gl/maps/zJV2YH6k28G36TEp8), Computer Lab 2.11.
* You may attend online through Teams, and log into lab computers remotely.

The reason is to accommodate amongst others the following circumstances:
* students who cannot physically be in Bristol
* students self-isolating
* students who do not want to be taught in-person

## Timetable

This applies all weeks except Week 18 (reading week). In Week 24, we still have
the lab booked but there is no new material (revision week), we'll just hold a
drop-in. 

## In-person sessions

During the aforementioned hours you may ask anyone not taking this unit to leave
the room if you need a seat/computer.

**Pending further instructions, please wear a mask at all times in the lab.**
The virus that causes COVID-19, i.e. SARS-CoV-2, spreads very efficiently
through [sharing
air](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted).
This is to say that breathing in the same room as someone else without masks and
efficient ventilation will, in fact, cause transmission. Thankfully, good
quality masks [prevent
infection](https://www.mpg.de/17916867/coronavirus-masks-risk-protection).

## Online support through Teams

The unit may be running in-person, but **we recommend that you use Teams to ask questions**. There are multiple benefits to this practice:

1. You can obtain a better thought-out, written answer.
2. Other students who have the same question (they always do) will benefit from seeing the answer.
3. You will be able to refer to your question and the answer when revising (if only to remember how hard it was the first time).

The lecturers and TAs will of course answer questions in-person, but may ask you to repeat your question on Teams. If you do not wish to do, they might post it anonymously, along with the answer.

## Schedule

The schedule for [part 1](exercises/part1) of the unit is as follows:

| Week | Activities         |
|------|--------------------|
| 13   | POSIX 1 & 2        |
| 14   | POSIX 3 & Git      |
| 15   | Build Tools 1 & 2  |
| 16   | Databases 1 & 2    |
| 17   | Databases 3 & 4    | 

These correspond to activities 1-10 on the [part 1 exercises](exercises/part1) page.

The first page for each activity contains links to the videos, slides, or readings for the activity that you are expected to watch or read before coming to the workshop. Some workshop exercises involve group work where there is a good reason for it, for example to practice working as a team with a git repository.

One of the most common pieces of student feedback since the start of the pandemic was that students would like videos or other materials out one week before they need to be used in a lab. We will try and implement this as far as possible for this unit: the materials for part 1 are all available from the start of term, and each video comes with its length listed in a table so you can better plan when you are going to watch them. This preparation also means the unit should be able to continue to run even if staff and most TAs are unwell one week - in this case you might miss out on some support but you will still be able to continue working independently.

The materials for part 2 are still in a draft stage and not all complete yet. You can have a peek by changing "part1" to "part2" in the link above, but assume that they may change before they get released.

## Coronavirus

We will hold our workshops in person, pandemic-permitting.

## Assessment

More details will be added here in due time.
