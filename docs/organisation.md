# Unit Organisation

## Timetable

This unit is organised around one large workshop held each week in MVB 2.11.
Attendance will be recorded for each of these sessions. There is online material
to support you, which you are expected to watch or read _before_ the workshop
session.

The workshops will run on **Thursdays, 13:00-16:00**.

During the aforementioned hours you can expect lecturer and TA support, and you
may ask anyone not taking this unit to leave the room if you need a
seat/computer.

There is also an in-person drop-in session scheduled _4-5pm on Fridays, in MVB
1.11_ (this may not be in your timetable). This is not a mandatory session --
and nothing will appear here that is not covered in the workshop material -- but
it is a place for you to ask questions, or listen to other students' questions
and answers to help you understand the material.


## Online support through Teams

The unit may be running in-person, but **we recommend that you use Teams to ask
questions**. There are multiple benefits to this practice:

1. You can obtain a better thought-out, written answer.
2. Other students who have the same question (they always do) will benefit from seeing the answer.
3. You will be able to refer to your question and the answer when revising (if only to remember how hard it was the first time).

The lecturers and TAs will of course answer questions in-person in the workshops
or drop-in sessions, but may ask you to repeat your question on Teams. If you do
not wish to do so, they might post it anonymously, along with the answer.


## How to learn in this unit

Learning in this unit is structured around hands-on exercises in the weekly
workshop. To support you in this, you are given access to video lectures that
introduce you to the tools or technologies you'll be working with in each week's
workshop. You are also able to see the workshop exercises ahead of the session
-- this is intentional.  

To make it clear, **you are expected to watch the videos and read the exercises
before each workshop.** This takes time, so we recommend that you start early.
Set some time aside on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday to watch the videos and
preview the exercises, so you can get the most out of the workshops.

Watching the videos will mean you already understand something about the
technologies before the session, while pre-reading the exercises means you'll
already know where to start and if there is anything you don't understand that
you need to ask about.

Please come to the workshops with questions. It goes without saying that:
* there are no silly questions
* we are here to help you move forward if you've gotten stuck in one part of the
  exercise.

Some activities will involve group work where there is a good reason for it --
for example, to practice working as a team with a git repository.  

If you have not finished the exercises by the end of the workshop, you are
expected to complete them in your own time.

## Assessment

The unit will be assessed via two 1-hour multiple-choice tests that will be
delivered during term time in special additional sessions that week -- these
should already be in your timetable.

The first test will take place in Week 19, and will cover all content from [part
1](exercises/part1) of the unit (Weeks 13-17).

The second test will take place in Week 23, and will cover all content from
[part 2](exercises/part2) of the unit (Weeks 19-22), barring the Complete
Application exercises, which you will tackle later in Week 23.


## Schedule

The schedule for [part 1](exercises/part1) of the unit is as follows:

| Week | Exercises          |
|------|--------------------|
| 13   | POSIX 1 & Git      |
| 14   | POSIX 2 & 3        |
| 15   | Build Tools        |
| 16   | Databases 1 & 2    |
| 17   | Databases 3 & 4    | 

(NB Week 13 is the week beginning on Monday 23 January 2023.)

Week 18 is reading week, so there will be no workshops that week.

The schedule for [part 2](exercises/part2) of the unit will be:

| Week | Exercises          |
|------|--------------------|
| 19   | HTTP & HTML        |
| 20   | CSS & CSS Grid     |
| 21   | JS & Webscraping   |
| 21   | React & Cloud      |
| 23   | _Application_      | 

The materials on this website will be updated throughout the course. You can
generally expect that the exercise materials for both the _current_ and _next_
weeks are up-to-date, to support your preparation. Videos for later sessions may
not be available earlier than one week in advance, but if they are present then
you may safely watch them when you wish. Practical exercises for later sessions 
may undergo minor alterations, but should remain essentially the same (barring
the Week 21 webscraping content, which is new this year and not yet available).
