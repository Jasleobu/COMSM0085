# Assessment

Your mark for the unit will be 100% from a final exam held online in the summer exam period.

Most or all of the exam will consist of automatically marked questions, which could include multiple choice, multiple answer ("select all that apply"), numeric answer, fill-in-the blank etc. questions.
