# Assessment

This unit has an attendance hurdle: you must attend 75% of the mandatory workshops (all weeks except 16, 17 and 24).

Once you have passed the hurdle, your mark for the unit will be 100% from a final exam held online in the summer exam period. We will update this page as soon as we have more information.

Most or all of the exam is likely to consist of automatically marked questions, which could include multiple choice, multiple answer ("select all that apply"), numeric answer, fill-in-the blank etc. questions.
