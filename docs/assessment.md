# Assessment

Your mark for the unit will be 100% from a final exam held online, which will take place during the final workshop of the course.

The exact date is the *13th of May 2021, 1-3pm*.

Most or all of the exam will consist of automatically marked questions, which could include multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions.

# Exam information

## Timing

The exam for this unit will be a 2-hour exam starting at 1pm British time on Thursday 13 May. The exam will be held online using Blackboard, and you will be able to find it on the day by
* going to Blackboard
* selecting the unitpage of COMSM0085
* and then selecting _Assessment, Submission and Feedback_ in the menu on the left.

Blackboard will automatically lock you out at the end of the exam. Make sure you have saved all your answers by then.

If you have alternative exam arrangements that give you extra time, then the time you have will be displayed on the first screen after you start the exam.

## In case of problems

In the (hopefully unlikely) event of a problem with the exam, e.g. a question not displaying correctly, Blackboard or your internet connection going down, you should e-mail the school office using the `coms-info@bristol.ac.uk` address - not the unit staff. If you think there is a mistake in a question, also inform the office and then carry on with the exam - we will not provide clarification or other updates during the exam, as we cannot ensure that this would reach all students equally and in time.

If your internet connection disconnects but comes back, or your computer crashes and restarts, you should be able to enter the test again and continue where you left off. Blackboard saves your progress (and that is linked to your user account, not your HTTP session).

## Academic integrity

During the exam, and for at least one hour afterwards (to account for students with extra time), you must not read or write anything online relating to the exam where other students could access it. During the exam itself, you must not use any online resources that are not explicitly allowed, and you must not read or write in any chats, groups, social media, e-mail or any other forms of communication with other students for any reason whatsoever.

**Just posting a message in a student group during the exam, even if it's only "the exam is hard", counts as an offence under the exam regulations, and students on other cohorts have been convicted for this during the January exams. To be on the safe side, you should have phones off during the exam just like you would in an exam hall.**

According to the official guidelines:

  - You must not collaborate or work with anyone else on your exam, either physically or virtually. 
  - The work submitted must be entirely your own.
  - We will view any instances of collusion as cheating and **will take them very seriously.**

## Allowed materials

Pen and paper (or digital equivalent). **Do not use a terminal**.

## Exam format

There are 40 questions on the exam, 35 of which are worth 1 point, and 5 of which are worth 2 points (and are harder).

There are three topics:
* POSIX and git
* Databases
* Web Fundamentals

There are fewer questions on Web Fundamentals, as we covered less material.

The exam not only tests what you know, but also whether you can reproduce this knowledge at a reasonable speed: the theory is that someone who has to Google each question and then search for the answer in the results would end up running out of time (quite apart from being guilty of a disciplinary offence), whereas someone who knows the material should be able to breeze through the questions and complete all the exam in very little time.

You will see all the questions at the same time. Every time you select an answer, Blackboard will automatically save it (and tell you so on the right hand side of the screen). A bar you can fold out at the top called _Question Completion Status_ which shows a button per question so you can jump to questions directly. It also shows which questions you have answered yet, or not. 

Below the final question there is a button called _Save and Submit_ on the bottom right hand. **Pressing this will end your exam and you only get one chance to do this, so make sure you don't press this before you're sure you've answered every question.**

There will be no long answer or essay type questions.

There will be no numerical questions, or any need to use the terminal.

You may encounter the following types of questions:
* Multiple choice: you need to pick exactly one answer from a list.
* Multiple answer: you are given a list of options and need to mark each one as true or false. There can be any number of true options, including none.
* Type one or more values: you will be shown a question with some text/number boxes (HTML `<input>` fields), and instructions on how to complete them. **You must follow these instructions exactly, as the automarker just does a string comparison - if I say “no spaces” and you put a space on the end, this counts as a mistake (and I will not give you the marks during the manual checking either).**
* Pick one or more values from dropdown boxes, for example to complete a command for a given task.
