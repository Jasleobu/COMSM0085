# Overview

This page contains the exercises for Part 1 (the first 5 weeks) of COMSM0085 Software Tools, namely

  - 2 weeks of POSIX
  - 1 week of build tools
  - 2 weeks of databases

Each week contains two 'activities' -- sets of exercises which are supported
by videos to watch (linked from the main page for each activity). The exercises
within each activity will require you to do some work within your Alpine Linux
VM in Vagrant, which we'll be supporting in the labs.
